# FSDI 114: Algorithms and Data Structures

## Assignment 1:

#### [is_anagram](is_anagram.py):

- [x] Create a function that checks whether two words are anagrams of each other.
- [x] Your solution must ignore casing (upper, lower) and spaces such that "I am lord voldemort" is found to be an anagram of "Tom Marvolo Riddle".


## Assignment 2:

#### [reverse_recursive](reverse_recursive.py):

- [x] Given a string, write a function that uses recursion to reverse it.

#### [product_list](product_list.py):
- [x] Given a list of integers, write a function that will return a list, in which for each index the element will be the product of all the integers except for the element at that index. For example, an input of [1, 2, 3, 4] would return [24, 12, 8, 6] by performing [2x3x4, 1x3x4, 1x2x4, 1x2x3]. You cannot use division in your answer! Meaning you can't simply multiply all the numbers and then divide by each element for each index!
